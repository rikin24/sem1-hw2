My domain includes customers, the movies they watch, the room in which they watch the movies, and staff for each room.

A customer has a name (e.g. John Smith), ticket ID (e.g. 428) and room number (e.g. 3).

 - Customers can watch many movies and each movie can be seen by many customers. When a customer is deleted, the record of the movies they watched is also deleted.

 - Movies can be watched by many customers. Customers can watch multiple movies.

 - Movies can each be shown in one room only, but each room can show many movies throughout the day (bidirectional).
